# GeoMoose Documentation Source

The GeoMoose documentation source is:
- located in the geomoose/gm3 repo (you are here).
- written in ReStructured Text (rst) format
- translated to HTML (and other formats) using Sphinx

The documentation appears on the [GeoMoose web site](https://www.geomoose.org/documentation.html) and is built automatically.

To build the documentation:
- install [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org)
- make your changes to a .rst file
- run make.bat (or make.sh) from the gm3/docs folder:

  `make.bat html`

- preview changes in docs/_site/html/index.html
