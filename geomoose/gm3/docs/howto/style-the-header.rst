How-to style the header
=======================

This how-to assumes making changes to the GeoMoose desktop example.

Changing the logo
-----------------

The logo is included as a basic ``<img>`` tag in the HTML. To change it
find this line in ``index.html``:

.. code:: html

    <img height="50" src="logo.png">

Then change the ``src`` attribute to an appropriate url for the desired
logo.

How to change the header background
-----------------------------------

The default background is an attractive medium grey but its not
everyone's preferred hue. The background can be changed by adding the
following CSS:

.. code:: css

    #header {
        background-color: darksteelblue;
    }

``darksteelblue`` can be changed with any CSS definition.

With a background image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A color could easily be substituted with an image, such as this
desirable granite pattern:

.. code:: css

    #header {
        background-image: url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Granite_Yosemite_P1160483.jpg/320px-Granite_Yosemite_P1160483.jpg);
    }
