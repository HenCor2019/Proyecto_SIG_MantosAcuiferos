How-to add a disclaimer
=======================

In GeoMoose 2.x, there was a dedicated extension for adding a disclaimer
to the application at startup. GeoMoose 3.X does not need a specific
extension as it provides the ability to add a dedicated Modal dialog to
the application at startup.

To create a disclaimer dialog:

1. Open your ``app.js`` file.
2. After ``app.loadMapbook`` there is a call to the ``then`` function
   which is passed an anonymous function. In the anonymous function add:
   ``javascript    app.alert('disclaimer', 'This page is protected by a lot of legal stuff. Seriously.');``

This line is best added at the end of the anonymous function, so if
using the desktop example it would follow the call to
``showTab('catalog');``.
