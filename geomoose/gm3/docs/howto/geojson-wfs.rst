How-to use GeoJSON/WFS
======================

By default GeoMoose will use GML to communicate with a WFS server. To
have GeoMoose use JSON, it needs to have the outputFormat ``<param>``
set to a JSON mime-type:

.. code:: xml

    <map-source name="my-wfs" type="wfs">
        ...
        <param name="outputFormat" value="application/json" />
        ...
    </map-source>
