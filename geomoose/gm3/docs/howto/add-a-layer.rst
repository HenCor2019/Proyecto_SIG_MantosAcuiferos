How-to add a layer
==================

This how-to provides instructions to add the a Firestations layer to the
GeoMoose demo. These instructions are similar to those found in the
GeoMoose Workshop. There is another similar how to on `adding a GeoJSON
file to GeoMoose <./add-geojson>`_.

Including Firestations from the Demo.
-------------------------------------

-  The firestations layer is included with the GeoMoose 3 Demo Data.
-  Open the ``mapbook.xml``

For MS4W installs, the mapbook is located here:
``C:\ms4w\apps\gm3\htdocs\examples\desktop\mapbook.xml``

-  Add the following after line 5:

   .. code:: xml

       <map-source name="firestations" type="mapserver">
           <file>./demo/firestations/firestations.map</file>
           <layer name="fire_stations"/>
       </map-source>

-  The above XML adds the ``firestations`` source with a
   ``fire_stations`` layer.

Add Firestations to the catalog
-------------------------------

-  GeoMoose separates the difference between the source-data with
   ``<map-source />`` es and presentation with the use of the
   ``<catalog>``.
-  In ``mapbook.xml`` find the ``<catalog>`` element, after it, add:

   .. code:: xml

       <layer src="firestations/fire_stations" title="Firestations"/>

-  This will add the ``fire_stations`` layer of the ``firestations``
   source to the catalog with the label "Firestations".

-  "Hard" Reload the Browser or clear-the-cache and reload. *Pro tip:
   Chrome can be very aggressive at caching AJAX loaded XML.*

-  The catalog should now have a 'Firestations' layer at the top!

Using identify with Firestatations
----------------------------------

The:doc:`./add-identify` guide
features the firestations layer. And describes adding identify and how
identify works.
